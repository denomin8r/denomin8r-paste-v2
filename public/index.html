                <p>Denomin8r is a digital collage artist and art project based in Brooklyn, NY. What began as an experiment applying analog collage techniques to digital images has evolved into a full-time art practice with a focus on public art, including <a href="/posters.html">mass-produced posters</a> and large-scale installation.</p>
                <p>This iteration of denomin8r.com aims to empower other creatives with resources to <a href="/wheatpasting.html">do their own wheatpasting</a> in their city.</p>
