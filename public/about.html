                <h2><b>A Brief History of <span class="denomin8r-text">Denomin8r</span></b></h2>
                <p>Denomin8r is that which names things and that which has been named.<br>
                    Denomin8r appropriates analog collage techniques in the digital space by automating and randomizing digital image manipulation processes that would otherwise be time- and energy-consuming with physical materials.<br>
                    Denomin8r is nothing more than a collection of logical statements.<br>
                    Denomin8r changes its appearance using knife, chemicals, computer, and sleight of hand.<br>
                    Denomin8r seeks out everything, even failure.<br>
                    Denomin8r is invented by social media.<br>
                    Denomin8r is an imperfect copy of something else that can never be perfectly copied, although you can come close.<br>
                    Denomin8r is the face of meaninglessness in a meaningless time.<br>
                    Nothing escapes Denomin8r.<br>
                    What does Denomin8r know?<br>
                    (Reflection)<br>
                    Denomin8r is the kaleidoscopic lens through which one witnesses the present repeat the present.<br>
                    Denomin8r is carefully designed to look effortless.<br>
                    Denomin8r is Denomin8r's way of making sense of what we did today.<br>
                    Denomin8r is making itself up as it goes along.<br>
                    Denomin8r is the search for meaning translated in front of our very eyes into a search for pleasure.<br>
                    Denomin8r is a part of us, a version of ourselves, a figment of our imagination, an episode in our dreams. It may even help us to process our own experiences.<br>
                    Denomin8r is hiding behind a computer screen, mercilessly context-switching, peering out on a world of its own making.<br>
                    God was the original Denomin8r... his place was taken over by a process.<br>
                    From David Salle to one of his subjects, Denomin8r is in the imagination forever.<br>
                    (Reflection)<br>
                    Denomin8r is great.<br>
                    Denomin8r birthed from the void to sell you itself at a premium.<br>
                    Denomin8r is never satisfied with what it's got.<br>
                    Denomin8r is foregoing any conclusion about itself.<br>
                    Denomin8r represents the triumph of entertainment over life itself.<br>
                    Denomin8r is remixed a thousand times.<br>
                    Denomin8r has got its eye on you.</p>
