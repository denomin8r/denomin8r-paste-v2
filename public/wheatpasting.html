                            <p>There are many recipes on the web. Feel free to experiment with different ratios and mixing methods, but the ingredients are pretty much the same.</p>

                                    <li>1 part flour (all-purpose or bread flour)</li>

                                    <li>A handful of corn starch or white sugar (optional, helps with adhesion)</li>

                                    <li>Simmer one part WATER on the stove</li>
                                    <li>Add WHEAT FLOUR and remaining WATER to the simmering mix</li>
                                    <li>Stir thoroughly for approx. 3-5 minutes on Medium heat, until a bubble rises to the top. The mix is now "boiled"</li>
                                    <li>Once the paste is boiled, switch heat to low and cook it for at least 30 minutes, stirring constantly. Adjust mix as necessary (adding water or flour) to get consistency to that of vanilla pudding</li>
                                    <li>Over time, the mix should become thinner and more transparent</li>
                                    <li>Once at desired consistency, remove from heat and let cool completely, stirring every 3-5 minutes</li>
                                    <li>Once the paste has cooled down completely, you can add a handful or SUGAR or CORN STARCH to help with adhesion. Stir this additive in completely.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p><b>Note:</b> Leftover paste can be stored in a jar in the refrigerator for up to 1 week</p>

                            <li><strong>Property respect:</strong> Avoid private property and respect community spaces</li>
                            <li><strong>Weather:</strong> Avoid pasting in rain or high humidity - wheatpaste needs to dry</li>
                            <li><strong>Surface selection:</strong> Choose clean, smooth surfaces for best adhesion</li>
                            <li><strong>Work quickly:</strong> Wheatpaste dries fast, so have everything ready before starting</li>
                            <li><strong>Clean up:</strong> Bring a rag to clean up any spills or drips</li>
                            <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Work in well-lit areas and be aware of your surroundings</li>
                            <li><strong>Belong:</strong> Wherever you are, act like you're completely comfortable and natural pasting up posters. If you act like a criminal, shady and looking over your shoulder, you'll be treated like one. As long as you look like you belong doing what you're doing, no one else will think twice. To establish credibility, you may wear something as simple as a yellow safety vest or some lanyard around your neck with credentials.</li>
